# EthernetMQTT
This project was purposed for the requirements of my internship program at Eyro Digital Teknologi, Surabaya.
It simply publish last six digit of my MAC Address and get it into filter so i can get only the hexacode without the (:). These last six digit used for the message content in the topic called "outTopic".
I am using several library, to support my Ethernet MQTT Development.
